# Project-1
User Story: 
As a  music lover, I want a website that allows me to view the top trending songs as well as upcoming concerts so that I can see my favorite artists perform live. 
With this site, I want to be able to; 
- See trending artists
- See an artists most recent albums upon clicking on them
- See any upcoming shows for artist(s) of interest
- Be able to explore new artists


Development Stages: 
1. DESIGN 

2. TESTING

3. ISSUES/DEBUGGING

4. DEPLOYMENT

Future Expectations:
- Have a carousel rotating the trending top 10 artists rather than top 3
- Incorporate a "favorite" button to have the site highlight/star a user's favorite performer
-- Explore a wide variety of artists relating to the favorites
